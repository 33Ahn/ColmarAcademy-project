This was the homework from Codecademy. 
The design specificity was given and I had to make a responsive web page.
The hardest part was not knowing where to start, how to code to follow the layout, class naming for CSS selectors, and making media queries to make it responsive.
The areas of improvements are getting more comfortable with HTML5 structures that align with W3C standards and CSS properties.
